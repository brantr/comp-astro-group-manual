\subsubsection{Nondiscrimination Statement}

Supporting ethical research requires ensuring a safe intellectual
environment where scientists can pursue their work. The UCSC
Computational Research Group will actively support all scientists
and does not discriminate on the 
basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, gender identity,
pregnancy, disability, age, medical condition (cancer-related), ancestry,
marital status, citizenship, sexual orientation, or status as a Vietnam-era
veteran or special disabled veteran.\\

The official University of California nondiscrimination statement can

adapted for ours.

\subsubsection{Statement on Harassment}
