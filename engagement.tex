\section{Engagement}
\label{sec:engagement}

Public outreach,
social media, and 
press engagement can
all form portions of our
work. You are of course 
welcome to pursue these
activities on your own
time and these will invariably
mix with professional 
activities. Below we 
list some related
guidelines.


\subsubsection{Social Media}
\label{sec:social_media}

Social media consist
of an important
platforms for communication
and networking.
When representing CARG
on social media, through
communicating your results,
discussing conference
activites, etc., please 
aim to be effective and
professional.
Ultimately, we are responsible
for maintaining our own
professional reputations.\\
\noindent
We do not currently maintain
group social media accounts.
Brant has a Twitter 
account, but he's been unable to access
it for a few years!
Other social networks
include Facebook and
LinkedIn.

\subsubsection{Press Engagement}
\label{sec:press_engagement}

Regarding press activity,
any engagement about
CARG research should be
coordinated with Brant.
He commits to include
and center other CARG 
members as appropriate.

\subsubsection{Public Outreach}
\label{sec:public_outreach}

Public outreach is an
important facet of our
mission as scientists.
Treat public outreach
as professionally as
your research. The
CARG will share
outreach resources.
Please responsibly manage
the relative prioritization
of
research and outreach.
