\abstract{\\\\
The University of California, Santa Cruz Computational Astrophysics Research Group consists of students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty conducting
forefront astrophysics research using computationally-intensive means. Our research efforts
include hydrodynamical and cosmological simulation,
deep learning applied to astronomy, and analysis of
large volume data. This Research Group Manual provides an overview of our policies including our Code of Conduct, and information on resources, mentorship,
and best practices.

TAKEN FROM CITL

This document provides an adaptable structure and set of topics to discuss when setting up a mentorship relationship. Both mentors and mentees can review their responses to these questions and work together to establish guidelines for their mentorship relationship, toward the end of supporting the mentee to succeed in their research program and to make progress toward their personal and professional goals. This document can be developed collaboratively and revisited whenever necessary.


1. Shared Goals \& Vision (List the goals of this working relationship. What do you both hope to get out of working together? What skills and experience will the mentee gain through the project, and how will that learning serve their larger academic, personal, professional goals?)

\begin{itemize}	
\item Research project goals:
\item Mentee’s personal/professional goals:
\item Mentor’s personal/professional goals: 
\item Shared vision of success for this project: 
\end{itemize}

2.	Approaches/Strategies/Steps to achieving listed goals (What do you both need to do to meet the above goals? Who is responsible for what actions?)
 
\begin{itemize}
\item Mentor’s role/tasks:
\item Mentee’s role/tasks:
\end{itemize}
 

3.	Meeting Practices (Frequency, duration, format and platform for meetings, who will schedule the meetings, etc.)



4.	Meeting Preparation (What will the mentee do to prepare for meetings? What will the mentor do to prepare for meetings?)
 
 
 
5.	Communication Etiquette (How will the mentor and mentee communicate between meetings? Establish preferred modes of contact, timeframe for responsiveness, when to contact faculty mentor v. when to contact graduate student mentor, etc.)



6.	Unplanned Issues (How will the mentor and mentee address unplanned issues that come up? For example, if the mentee gets stuck while working on the project, what are some steps they can take?)



7.	Confidentiality Concerns (Ensure you are on the same page in terms of keeping particular discussions in confidence. If there are topics which either of you feel are off-limits for discussion, those can be named.)
