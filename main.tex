\abstract{\\\\
The University of California, Santa Cruz Computational Astrophysics Research Group consists of students, postdoctoral scholars, and faculty conducting
forefront astrophysics research using computationally-intensive means. Our research efforts
include hydrodynamical and cosmological simulation,
deep learning applied to astronomy, and analysis of
large-volume data. This Research Group Manual provides an overview of our policies including our Code of Conduct, and information on resources, mentorship,
and best practices. And we're a fun group of people!

% The bibliography will probably be heavily edited during typesetting.
% We'll parse it and, using the arxiv number or the journal data, will
% query inspire, trying to verify the data (this will probalby spot
% eventual typos) and retrive the document DOI and eventual errata.
% We however suggest to always provide author, title and journal data:
% in short all the informations that clearly identify a document.
