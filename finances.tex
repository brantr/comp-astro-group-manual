\section{Finances \& Reimbursements}
\label{sec:finances}

The CARG is funded primarily by
NASA,
the National Science Foundation,
and Hubble and James Webb Space
Telescope-related grants. 

\subsubsection{Accounts}
For reference, here is a listing of all the CARG accounts and FOAPALs.
\begin{itemize}
\item NSF MRI 81428-443162
\item NASA ATP 83290-443162
\item JWST NIRCam 63513-443162
\item WFIRST 83263-443162
\item LACES 58437-443162 (defunct)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Travel Reimbursements}

Always get pre-approval from 
Brant on travel,
including conference fees,
flight arrangements, 
hotel arrangements, etc. 
University policies related to
travel can be found at \href{https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Travel_Process.aspx}{https://financial.ucsc.edu/Pages/Travel\_Process.aspx}. These resources
supersede any of Brant's 
understandings of reimbursement
policies.\\

\noindent
Perhaps the most important form is the 
\href{https://financial.ucsc.edu/Financial_Affairs_Forms/Post_Travel_Expense.pdf}{Post Travel Form}, which
you will need to request reimbursement.
This form should be filled out by
the CARG members who are 
requesting the reimbursement, and
then provided to Brant to fill in
the FOAPAL info and authorization.
If you need help, ask Brant.
